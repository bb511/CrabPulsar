### Preamble

The 13m (42ft) parabolic radio telescope is used to obtain data. Unwanted power or "spillover" is collected from the edges of the dish. An incoming signal, induces an electromagnetic signal in the feed which is converted into useful data after signal processing, as summarized in [Figure 1]. The data is reconded with a bandwidth of 10 MHz centred at the frequency of 610 MHz. A section of the incoming signal received, which passes the filter, is Fourier transformed to generate multiple frequency channels. The power in each channel is computed and the value is obtained every 51 $\mu$s.
