## Understanding pulse profiles

single peak -- core emission beam close to the magnetic axis (core emission model)
double peak -- hollow emission cone surrounding the magnetic axis (cone emission model)
triple peak -- core-cone model

patch model -- all components of the pulse profile caused by scattered emission beams in the shape of a patch

The pulse width can be calculated by measuring the distance between adjacent peaks. 

Emission beam radius $$\rho = 5.4^o P^{-0.5}$$

The FFT of a periodic pulse shows a series of spikes. The distance between the spikes is given as $1/P$.
