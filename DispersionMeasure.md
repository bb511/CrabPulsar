## 2.2 Theory

The time delay, $t$, at radio frequency, $f (MHz)$ is given by,
\begin{equation}
 t = 4150(\frac{DM}{f^2})s
 \end{equation} 
where $DM$ is the _disperion measure_ ($cm^{-3}pc$), or the integrated column density of free electrons along the line of sight [1](About.md#1). 

#### Some details about the shape of the de-dispersed pulse profile (need to place it in relavant context)
A single peak in the pulse profile implies that core emission beam is close to the magnetic axis (core emission model). A double peak model implies hollow emission cone surrounding the magnetic axis (cone emission model). While a triple peak profile is explained by the core-cone model. The patch model states that all components of the pulse profile are caused by scattered emission beams in the shape of a patch.
Emission beam radius is given as, $$\rho = 5.4^o P^{-0.5}$$ <mark>Aside: need to check if we can calculate this.</mark>
